## Overview

This document tracks ongoing and future improvements for the database integration layer of the Claygrounds Server. These are not urgent blockers, but are recommended for increased robustness, security, and maintainability.

## API & Security

- [ ] Validate configuration on startup (fail fast if missing)

## Manual Testing
- [ ] Test direct DB connection and CRUD operations via `pgDatabaseUtils.js`
- [ ] Test API-driven DB operations via `apiDatabaseClient.js`
- [ ] Test all `/api/database` endpoints (success and failure cases)
- [ ] Test error handling and logging for all failure scenarios
- [ ] Test with missing/invalid environment variables
- [ ] Test security: ensure only allowed SQL queries are executed
- [ ] Test token-based confirmation for save operations
- [ ] Test batch uploads and stats reporting

## Documentation
- [ ] Review and update this document as changes are made
- [ ] Add usage examples and troubleshooting tips as needed
