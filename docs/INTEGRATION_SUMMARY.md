## 🎮 Navigation Flow

### Hierarchical System
```
Country (India) → State → District → Cities
```

1. **Country Level**: View all Indian states
2. **State Level**: Select a state to see its districts and enable cities
3. **District Level**: Click districts for details and selection
4. **Cities Level**: Toggle cities on/off, filter by importance

### Controls Layout
- **Top-right**: View controls (Top-down/Isometric)
- **Right side**: Cities control (when in state selection)
- **Right side**: District control (when state is selected)
- **Bottom**: Game UI with navigation

## 🎨 Visual Features

### Cities
- **Markers**: Circular markers with size based on zoom level
- **Colors**: Red (top 10) → Orange (top 50) → Gray (others)
- **Labels**: City names appear at higher zoom levels
- **Popups**: Show city name, state, population rank, coordinates

### Districts
- **Boundaries**: Line boundaries with varying thickness
- **Colors**: Red (metro) → Orange (major) → Blue (city) → Gray (regional)
- **Fill**: Selected districts get colored fill overlay
- **Labels**: District names appear at zoom level 8+

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### State Management
```javascript
// Cities state
const [showCities, setShowCities] = useState(false);
const [cityFilter, setCityFilter] = useState('all');
const [cityPopup, setCityPopup] = useState(null);

// Districts state
const [selectedDistrict, setSelectedDistrict] = useState(null);
const [showDistricts, setShowDistricts] = useState(true);
```

### Event Handlers
- `handleCityClick`: Creates popups for city information
- `handleDistrictClick`: Selects districts and shows details
- `handleDistrictSelect`: Handles district selection from control panel

### Integration Points
- **MapContainer.js**: Main integration point with all components
- **Cleanup**: Proper cleanup of popups and state on navigation
- **Responsive**: Works with existing view modes and map styles

## 🎯 User Experience

### State Selection Mode

### State Focused Mode
- District boundaries appear for selected state only
- District control panel shows with statistics
- Cities filter to selected state automatically
- Hierarchical navigation: State → District → Cities

### Keyboard Navigation
- Existing keyboard controls work alongside new features
- ESC key properly resets cities and districts state

## 📱 Responsive Design

- Popups are mobile-friendly
- Touch interactions work on all devices

## 🚀 Performance
- Layers only render when needed (state-based filtering)
- Efficient MapBox layer management
- Zoom-based label visibility to prevent overcrowding
- Proper cleanup prevents memory leaks

The integration creates a seamless hierarchical navigation experience where users can explore India from country level down to individual cities and districts! 🎉
